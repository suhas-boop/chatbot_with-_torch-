>Project to build ans interactive  Chatbot using pytorch 

## About the Chatbot

1)Handle loading and preprocessing of Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus dataset

2)Implement a sequence-to-sequence model with Luong attention mechanism

3)Jointly train encoder and decoder models using mini-batches

4)Implement greedy-search decoding module

5)Interact with trained chatbot

## Prerequisites
 python >3.6
 torch
 re
 unicodedata
 codecs
 itertools

## To Run the chatbot 

1. download the two filesin repo along with Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus( click [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) to download the zip)

2. Cd to the downloaded directory 
```
   cd {directory path }
```
3. run the deploy file
```
  	python deploy.py 
```
 it take few minutes to train the model 


 then enjoy!
